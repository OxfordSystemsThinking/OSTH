### About us

We set up the Oxford Systems Thinking Hub in Summer 2024 to promote and develop systems thinking across the University of Oxford. We had met colleagues using related ideas and methods across a wide range of projects, but without a common place to share insights.

The Hub is a platform for members of the five [Oxford Networks for the Environment](https://www.ox.ac.uk/one-network) and the wider university to find common ground in the theory and practice of systems thinking. Our aim is to accelerate learning and collaboration to tackle the world's most complex challenges.
