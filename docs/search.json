    "text": "Upcoming activities\nFor Trinity Term 2025, our reading and discussion will look at advancements in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods aspects of systems thinking.\nSession 1 (qual-focus): Thursday 15th May 1-2pm, Manor Road Building seminar room D\nThis exchange in ‘Ecosystems and People’ explores the need and practicalities of recognising relationality in systems thinking on sustainability. It provides insight into the challenges of reconciling different traditions of systems thinking. We suggest reading the first paper and perhaps also having a look at the responses (which are quite short).\n\nA relational turn for sustainability science? Relational thinking, leverage points and transformations (West et al. 2020).\nReply to West et al. – Engaging with the pragmatics of relational thinking, leverage points and transformations (Raymond et al. 2020).\nReply to Raymond et al. – Putting relational thinking to work in sustainability science (West et al. 2021).\n\nSession 2 (quant-focus): Thursday 29th May 1-2pm, Manor Road Building seminar room D\nThis ‘Nature Sustainability’ paper describes a full quantitative system dynamics model. We can discuss the model details and/or think about how the approach is framed to reach a broad audience.\n\nModelling the drivers of a widespread shift to sustainable diets (Eker et al. 2019).\n\nSession 3 Integrated: Thursday 12th June 1-2pm, Manor Road Building seminar room D\nThis ‘Systems Research and Behavioral Science’ paper explores how conceptualisations of justice can be brought into system dynamics models, which helps us see more how models are used in practice and how they interface with deeper social science concepts.\n\nIntegrating distributive justice in system dynamics models of sustainability transitions (Kopainsky et al. 2024).\n\n\n\nOur reading archive\n\nThe Four Waves of Systems Thinking. (Cabrera et al. 2023; Journal of Systems Thinking).\nIntroduction to Systems Thinking (Daniel Kim 1999; The Systems Thinker blog)\nPart one of the ‘Thinking in Systems: A Primer’ book by Donella Meadows\n\nThere is online access through the uni library\nOr there is a free PDF via Florida Tech Uni"

These activities will begin again in the new academic year.\nWe are always happy for suggestions, so please let us know if you have ideas.\n\n\nPrevious events\nMarch 2025 – Fireside chat with Dr Peter Drobac – Hosted by INET Oxford\nAn educator, doctor and social entrepreneur, Dr Drobac is the former Director of the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship at the University of Oxford. He is a specialist in the development of high-performing health and education systems. For over a decade, Peter played a key role in the transformation of Rwanda’s health system, which has delivered unprecedented gains in population health and prosperity. As executive director of Partners In Health in Rwanda, he established community-based health system incubators that developed and scaled care delivery innovations from infectious diseases to cancer. He was a co-founder and first executive director of the University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) in Rwanda. Now, Peter is the CEO of Crucible, a startup unlocking Africa’s human potential by launching a network of secondary school leadership academies for the continent’s most talented teenagers.\nFebruary 2025 – Fireside chat with Dr Monika Zurek – Hosted by INET Oxford\nDr Zurek is a titular associate professor and senior researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford and a member of the ECI Food System Transformation Group. For more than 20 years she has worked on food systems change, environment and development interactions in research and international organisations as well as in the consulting and the philanthropic sector. Prior to joining ECI, Monika worked with Climate Focus, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the FAO, and the International nMaize and Wheat Improvement Center. Monika has also been a lead author for various environmental assessments such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, AR4), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD).\nDecember 2024 – Workshops: Systems thinking masterclasses for researchers and policy-makers – Hosted by the Agile Initiative and GALLANT project\nThe masterclasses were designed for researchers and policy-makers to build their network whilst delving into the practice of systems thinking. Participants were welcomed from all disciplines regardless of prior experience/familiarity with systems approaches and methods. Systems thinking is a broad and sometimes ill-defined field. These masterclasses, introduced a range of methods, modelling, and thinking, from the conceptual, through to qualitative, participatory, and quantitative. Discussions covered core concepts and methods, effective practices, maximising impact, and career development. \nNovember 2024 – Workshop: Systems mapping for environmental domains – Hosted by ACCESS and CECAN\nThis workshop, facilitated by Dr Alexandra Penn and Dr Pete Barbrook-Johnson, showcased practical uses of systems mapping across a range of situations, stakeholders and challenges. It provided hands-on experience of constructing a systems map collaboratively to produce actionable insights on applying systems mapping.\nOctober 2024 – Seminar with Dr Abubakr Muhammad – Hosted by OWN\nDr Abubakr Muhammad is an Associate Professor, founding director of the Center for Water Informatics & Technology (WIT), and lead of the NCRA National Agricultural Robotics Lab at Lahore University of Management Science. He serves on various advisory panels to government agencies and industry in Pakistan on water, climate and agricultural policy, especially on the use of emerging digital technologies for these sectors. His seminar titled: ‘From behavior to policy: a systems perspective on establishing hydrometeorological monitoring networks in complex river basins’ presented work on indigenously building large-scale earth observation networks using a fusion of technologies and community participation in South Asia and the Indus basin. He discussed how combining monitoring data with agent-based socio-hydrological models and basin-scale integrated assessment models has enabled large-scale policy interventions for irrigation demand management, the exploration of nature-based solutions in agriculture, preparation for rare events in transboundary rivers, and generation of scenarios for investment options in the Water-Energy-Food-Climate nexus.\nMay 2023 – Workshop: Systems thinking for environmental research and governance – Hosted by SoGE\nAt the Oxford School of Geography and the Environment (SoGE), systems thinking is used in varied forms to understand the complex dynamics of human-environment interactions. Research spans water, food, energy, biodiversity, climate, marine protection and other areas – with cross-cutting work on economic and social justice. Projects are highly interdisciplinary, but ongoing knowledge exchange between research groups is challenging. This workshop convened research groups to celebrate and strengthen the use of systems thinking and systems tools at SOGE. With impact in mind, we were joined by systems-thinking leaders from the UK government to discuss the use of systems-based research in environmental governance decision-making."

    "text": "About us\nWe set up the Oxford Systems Thinking Hub in Summer 2024 to promote and develop systems thinking across the University of Oxford. We had met colleagues using related ideas and methods across a wide range of projects, but without a common place to share insights.\nThe Hub is a platform for members of the five Oxford Networks for the Environment and the wider university to find common ground in the theory and practice of systems thinking. Our aim is to accelerate learning and collaboration to tackle the world’s most complex challenges.\n\n\nGet involved\nWant to connect?
