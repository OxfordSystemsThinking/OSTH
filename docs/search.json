We had met many colleagues using Systems Thinking, related ideas, and methods, but without a common place to share ideas and develop new research. We felt the need for an intellectual home for Systems Thinking at Oxford; we hope the hub will be just that!\n\n\nGet involved\nIf you would like to chat about our work, attend events, or join the hub, get in touch at peter.barbrook-johnson@ouce.ox.ac.uk and saskia.nowicki@ouce.ox.ac.uk"
